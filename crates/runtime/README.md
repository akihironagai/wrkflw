## wrkflw-runtime

Runtime abstractions for executing steps in containers or emulation.

- Container management primitives used by the executor
- Emulation mode helpers (run on host without containers)

### Example

```rust
// This crate is primarily consumed by `wrkflw-executor`.
// Prefer using the executor API instead of calling runtime directly.
```
