## Features

- **TUI Interface**: A full-featured terminal user interface for managing and monitoring workflow executions
- **Validate Workflow Files**: Check for syntax errors and common mistakes in GitHub Actions workflow files with proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
- **Execute Workflows Locally**: Run workflows directly on your machine using Docker or Podman containers
- **Multiple Container Runtimes**: Support for Docker, Podman, and emulation mode for maximum flexibility
- **Job Dependency Resolution**: Automatically determines the correct execution order based on job dependencies
- **Container Integration**: Execute workflow steps in isolated containers with proper environment setup
- **GitHub Context**: Provides GitHub-like environment variables and workflow commands
- **Rootless Execution**: Podman support enables running containers without root privileges
- **Action Support**: Supports various GitHub Actions types:
  - Docker container actions
  - JavaScript actions
  - Composite actions
  - Local actions
- **Special Action Handling**: Native handling for commonly used actions like `actions/checkout`
- **Reusable Workflows (Caller Jobs)**: Execute jobs that call reusable workflows via `jobs.<id>.uses` (local path or `owner/repo/path@ref`)
- **Output Capturing**: View logs, step outputs, and execution details
- **Parallel Job Execution**: Runs independent jobs in parallel for faster workflow execution
- **Trigger Workflows Remotely**: Manually trigger workflow runs on GitHub or GitLab

## Requirements

### Container Runtime (Optional)

WRKFLW supports multiple container runtimes for isolated execution:

- **Docker**: The default container runtime. Install from [docker.com](https://docker.com)
- **Podman**: A rootless container runtime. Perfect for environments where Docker isn't available or permitted. Install from [podman.io](https://podman.io)
- **Emulation**: No container runtime required. Executes commands directly on the host system

### Podman Support

Podman is particularly useful in environments where:
- Docker installation is not permitted by your organization
- Root privileges are not available for Docker daemon
- You prefer rootless container execution
- Enhanced security through daemonless architecture is desired

To use Podman:
```bash
# Install Podman (varies by OS)
# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew install podman

# On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install podman

# Initialize Podman machine (macOS/Windows)
podman machine init
podman machine start

# Use with wrkflw
wrkflw run --runtime podman .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

## Installation

The recommended way to install `wrkflw` is using Rust's package manager, Cargo:

### Using Cargo Install (Recommended)
```bash
cargo install wrkflw
```

### From Source

Clone the repository and build using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bahdotsh/wrkflw.git
cd wrkflw
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available at `target/release/wrkflw`.

## Usage

The simplest way to use WRKFLW is to navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
wrkflw
```

This will automatically detect and load all workflows from `.github/workflows` directory into the TUI interface.

WRKFLW also provides three main command modes:

### Validating Workflow Files

```bash
# Validate all workflow files in the default location (.github/workflows)
wrkflw validate

# Validate a specific workflow file
wrkflw validate path/to/workflow.yml

# Validate workflows in a specific directory
wrkflw validate path/to/workflows

# Validate with verbose output
wrkflw validate --verbose path/to/workflow.yml

# Validate GitLab CI pipelines
wrkflw validate .gitlab-ci.yml --gitlab

# Disable exit codes for custom error handling (default: enabled)
wrkflw validate --no-exit-code path/to/workflow.yml
```

#### Exit Codes for CI/CD Integration

By default, `wrkflw validate` sets the exit code to `1` when validation fails, making it perfect for CI/CD pipelines and scripts:

```bash
# In CI/CD scripts - validation failure will cause the script to exit
if ! wrkflw validate; then
    echo "❌ Workflow validation failed!"
    exit 1
fi
echo "✅ All workflows are valid!"

# For custom error handling, disable exit codes
wrkflw validate --no-exit-code
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Validation completed (check output for details)"
fi
```

**Exit Code Behavior:**
- `0`: All validations passed successfully
- `1`: One or more validation failures detected
- `2`: Command usage error (invalid arguments, file not found, etc.)

### Running Workflows in CLI Mode

```bash
# Run a workflow with Docker (default)
wrkflw run .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run a workflow with Podman instead of Docker
wrkflw run --runtime podman .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run a workflow in emulation mode (without containers)
wrkflw run --runtime emulation .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Run with verbose output
wrkflw run --verbose .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Preserve failed containers for debugging
wrkflw run --preserve-containers-on-failure .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Using the TUI Interface

```bash
# Open TUI with workflows from the default directory
wrkflw tui

# Open TUI with a specific directory of workflows
wrkflw tui path/to/workflows

# Open TUI with a specific workflow pre-selected
wrkflw tui path/to/workflow.yml

# Open TUI with Podman runtime
wrkflw tui --runtime podman

# Open TUI in emulation mode
wrkflw tui --runtime emulation
```

### Triggering Workflows Remotely

```bash
# Trigger a workflow remotely on GitHub
wrkflw trigger workflow-name --branch main --input key1=value1 --input key2=value2

# Trigger a pipeline remotely on GitLab
wrkflw trigger-gitlab --branch main --variable key1=value1 --variable key2=value2
```

## TUI Controls

The terminal user interface provides an interactive way to manage workflows:

- **Tab / 1-4**: Switch between tabs (Workflows, Execution, Logs, Help)
- **Up/Down or j/k**: Navigate lists
- **Space**: Toggle workflow selection
- **Enter**: Run selected workflow / View job details
- **r**: Run all selected workflows
- **a**: Select all workflows
- **n**: Deselect all workflows
- **e**: Cycle through runtime modes (Docker → Podman → Emulation)
- **v**: Toggle between Execution and Validation mode
- **Esc**: Back / Exit detailed view
- **q**: Quit application

## Examples

### Validating a Workflow

```bash
$ wrkflw validate .github/workflows/rust.yml
Validating GitHub workflow file: .github/workflows/rust.yml... Validating 1 workflow file(s)...
✅ Valid: .github/workflows/rust.yml

Summary: 1 valid, 0 invalid

$ echo $?
0

# Example with validation failure
$ wrkflw validate .github/workflows/invalid.yml
Validating GitHub workflow file: .github/workflows/invalid.yml... Validating 1 workflow file(s)...
❌ Invalid: .github/workflows/invalid.yml
   1. Job 'test' is missing 'runs-on' field
   2. Job 'test' is missing 'steps' section

Summary: 0 valid, 1 invalid

$ echo $?
1
```

### Running a Workflow

```bash
$ wrkflw run .github/workflows/rust.yml

Executing workflow: .github/workflows/rust.yml
============================================================
Runtime: Docker
------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Job succeeded: build

------------------------------------------------------------
  ✅ Checkout code
  ✅ Set up Rust
  ✅ Build
  ✅ Run tests

✅ Workflow completed successfully!
```

### Quick TUI Startup

```bash
# Navigate to project root and run wrkflw
$ cd my-project
$ wrkflw

# This will automatically load .github/workflows files into the TUI
```

## System Requirements

- Rust 1.67 or later
- Container Runtime (optional, for container-based execution):
  - **Docker**: Traditional container runtime
  - **Podman**: Rootless alternative to Docker  
  - **None**: Emulation mode runs workflows using local system tools

## How It Works

WRKFLW parses your GitHub Actions workflow files and executes each job and step in the correct order. For container modes (Docker/Podman), it creates containers that closely match GitHub's runner environments. The workflow execution process:

1. **Parsing**: Reads and validates the workflow YAML structure
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Creates an execution plan based on job dependencies
3. **Environment Setup**: Prepares GitHub-like environment variables and context
4. **Execution**: Runs each job and step either in containers (Docker/Podman) or through local emulation
5. **Monitoring**: Tracks progress and captures outputs in the TUI or command line

## Advanced Features

### GitHub Environment Files Support

WRKFLW supports GitHub's environment files and special commands:

- `GITHUB_OUTPUT`: For storing step outputs (`echo "result=value" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`)
- `GITHUB_ENV`: For setting environment variables (`echo "VAR=value" >> $GITHUB_ENV`)
- `GITHUB_PATH`: For modifying the PATH (`echo "/path/to/dir" >> $GITHUB_PATH`)
- `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`: For creating step summaries (`echo "# Summary" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`)

### Composite Actions

WRKFLW supports composite actions, which are actions made up of multiple steps. This includes:

- Local composite actions referenced with `./path/to/action`
- Remote composite actions from GitHub repositories
- Nested composite actions (composite actions that use other actions)

### Container Cleanup

WRKFLW automatically cleans up any containers created during workflow execution (Docker/Podman), even if the process is interrupted with Ctrl+C.

For debugging failed workflows, you can preserve containers that fail by using the `--preserve-containers-on-failure` flag:

```bash
# Preserve failed containers for debugging
wrkflw run --preserve-containers-on-failure .github/workflows/build.yml

# Also available in TUI mode
wrkflw tui --preserve-containers-on-failure
```

When a container fails with this flag enabled, WRKFLW will:
- Keep the failed container running instead of removing it
- Log the container ID and provide inspection instructions
- Show a message like: `Preserving container abc123 for debugging (exit code: 1). Use 'docker exec -it abc123 bash' to inspect.` (Docker)
- Or: `Preserving container abc123 for debugging (exit code: 1). Use 'podman exec -it abc123 bash' to inspect.` (Podman)

This allows you to inspect the exact state of the container when the failure occurred, examine files, check environment variables, and debug issues more effectively.

### Podman-Specific Features

When using Podman as the container runtime, you get additional benefits:

**Rootless Operation:**
```bash
# Run workflows without root privileges
wrkflw run --runtime podman .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

**Enhanced Security:**
- Daemonless architecture reduces attack surface
- User namespaces provide additional isolation
- No privileged daemon required

**Container Inspection:**
```bash
# List preserved containers
podman ps -a --filter "name=wrkflw-"

# Inspect a preserved container's filesystem (without executing)
podman mount <container-id>

# Or run a new container with the same volumes
podman run --rm -it --volumes-from <failed-container> ubuntu:20.04 bash

# Clean up all wrkflw containers
podman ps -a --filter "name=wrkflw-" --format "{{.Names}}" | xargs podman rm -f
```

**Compatibility:**
- Drop-in replacement for Docker workflows
- Same CLI options and behavior
- Identical container execution environment

## Limitations

### Supported Features
- ✅ Basic workflow syntax and validation (all YAML syntax checks, required fields, and structure) with proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
- ✅ Job dependency resolution and parallel execution (all jobs with correct 'needs' relationships are executed in the right order, and independent jobs run in parallel)
- ✅ Matrix builds (supported for reasonable matrix sizes; very large matrices may be slow or resource-intensive)
- ✅ Environment variables and GitHub context (all standard GitHub Actions environment variables and context objects are emulated)
- ✅ Container actions (all actions that use containers are supported in Docker and Podman modes)
- ✅ JavaScript actions (all actions that use JavaScript are supported)
- ✅ Composite actions (all composite actions, including nested and local composite actions, are supported)
- ✅ Local actions (actions referenced with local paths are supported)
- ✅ Special handling for common actions (e.g., `actions/checkout` is natively supported)
- ✅ Reusable workflows (caller): Jobs that use `jobs.<id>.uses` to call local or remote workflows are executed; inputs and secrets are propagated to the called workflow
- ✅ Workflow triggering via `workflow_dispatch` (manual triggering of workflows is supported)
- ✅ GitLab pipeline triggering (manual triggering of GitLab pipelines is supported)
- ✅ Environment files (`GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_PATH`, `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` are fully supported)
- ✅ TUI interface for workflow management and monitoring
- ✅ CLI interface for validation, execution, and remote triggering
- ✅ Output capturing (logs, step outputs, and execution details are available in both TUI and CLI)
- ✅ Container cleanup (all containers created by wrkflw are automatically cleaned up, even on interruption)

### Limited or Unsupported Features (Explicit List)
- ❌ GitHub secrets and permissions: Only basic environment variables are supported. GitHub's encrypted secrets and fine-grained permissions are NOT available.
- ❌ GitHub Actions cache: Caching functionality (e.g., `actions/cache`) is NOT supported in emulation mode and only partially supported in Docker and Podman modes (no persistent cache between runs).
- ❌ GitHub API integrations: Only basic workflow triggering is supported. Features like workflow status reporting, artifact upload/download, and API-based job control are NOT available.
- ❌ GitHub-specific environment variables: Some advanced or dynamic environment variables (e.g., those set by GitHub runners or by the GitHub API) are emulated with static or best-effort values, but not all are fully functional.
- ❌ Large/complex matrix builds: Very large matrices (hundreds or thousands of job combinations) may not be practical due to performance and resource limits.
- ❌ Network-isolated actions: Actions that require strict network isolation or custom network configuration may not work out-of-the-box and may require manual container runtime configuration.
- ❌ Some event triggers: Only `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger) is fully supported. Other triggers (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `release`, etc.) are NOT supported.
- ❌ GitHub runner-specific features: Features that depend on the exact GitHub-hosted runner environment (e.g., pre-installed tools, runner labels, or hardware) are NOT guaranteed to match. Only a best-effort emulation is provided.
- ❌ Windows and macOS runners: Only Linux-based runners are fully supported. Windows and macOS jobs are NOT supported.
- ❌ Service containers: Service containers (e.g., databases defined in `services:`) are only supported in Docker and Podman modes. In emulation mode, they are NOT supported.
- ❌ Artifacts: Uploading and downloading artifacts between jobs/steps is NOT supported.
- ❌ Job/step timeouts: Custom timeouts for jobs and steps are NOT enforced.
- ❌ Job/step concurrency and cancellation: Features like `concurrency` and job cancellation are NOT supported.
- ❌ Expressions and advanced YAML features: Most common expressions are supported, but some advanced or edge-case expressions may not be fully implemented.
- ⚠️ Reusable workflows (limits):
  - Outputs from called workflows are not propagated back to the caller (`needs.<id>.outputs.*` not supported)
  - `secrets: inherit` is not special-cased; provide a mapping to pass secrets
  - Remote calls clone public repos via HTTPS; private repos require preconfigured access (not yet implemented)
  - Deeply nested reusable calls work but lack cycle detection beyond regular job dependency checks

## Reusable Workflows

WRKFLW supports executing reusable workflow caller jobs.

### Syntax

```yaml
jobs:
  call-local:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/shared.yml

  call-remote:
    uses: my-org/my-repo/.github/workflows/shared.yml@v1
    with:
      foo: bar
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}
```

### Behavior
- Local references are resolved relative to the current working directory.
- Remote references are shallow-cloned at the specified `@ref` into a temporary directory.
- `with:` entries are exposed to the called workflow as environment variables `INPUT_<KEY>`.
- `secrets:` mapping entries are exposed as environment variables `SECRET_<KEY>`.
- The called workflow executes according to its own `jobs`/`needs`; a summary of its job results is reported as a single result for the caller job.

### Current limitations
- Outputs from called workflows are not surfaced back to the caller.
- `secrets: inherit` is not supported; specify an explicit mapping.
- Private repositories for remote `uses:` are not yet supported.

### Runtime Mode Differences
- **Docker Mode**: Provides the closest match to GitHub's environment, including support for Docker container actions, service containers, and Linux-based jobs. Some advanced container configurations may still require manual setup.
- **Podman Mode**: Similar to Docker mode but uses Podman for container execution. Offers rootless container support and enhanced security. Fully compatible with Docker-based workflows.
- **Emulation Mode**: Runs workflows using the local system tools. Limitations:
  - Only supports local and JavaScript actions (no Docker container actions)
  - No support for service containers
  - No caching support
  - Some actions may require adaptation to work locally
  - Special action handling is more limited

### Best Practices
- Test workflows in both Docker and emulation modes to ensure compatibility
- Keep matrix builds reasonably sized for better performance
- Use environment variables instead of GitHub secrets when possible
- Consider using local actions for complex custom functionality
- Test network-dependent actions carefully in both modes

## Remote Workflow Triggering

WRKFLW allows you to manually trigger workflow runs on GitHub through both the command-line interface (CLI) and the terminal user interface (TUI).

### Requirements:

1. You need a GitHub token with workflow permissions. Set it in the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
   ```

2. The workflow must have the `workflow_dispatch` trigger defined in your workflow YAML:
   ```yaml
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:
       inputs:
         name:
           description: 'Person to greet'
           default: 'World'
           required: true
         debug:
           description: 'Enable debug mode'
           required: false
           type: boolean
           default: false
   ```

### Triggering from CLI:

```bash
# Trigger a workflow using the default branch
wrkflw trigger workflow-name

# Trigger a workflow on a specific branch
wrkflw trigger workflow-name --branch feature-branch

# Trigger with input parameters
wrkflw trigger workflow-name --branch main --input name=Alice --input debug=true
```

After triggering, WRKFLW will provide feedback including the URL to view the triggered workflow on GitHub.

### Triggering from TUI:

1. Launch the TUI interface:
   ```bash
   wrkflw tui
   ```

2. Navigate to the "Workflows" tab (use `Tab` key or press `1`).

3. Use the arrow keys (`↑`/`↓`) or `j`/`k` to select the desired workflow.

4. Press `t` to trigger the selected workflow.

5. If the workflow is successfully triggered, you'll see a notification in the UI.

6. You can monitor the triggered workflow's execution on GitHub using the provided URL.

### Verifying Triggered Workflows:

To verify that your workflow was triggered:

1. Visit your GitHub repository in a web browser.
2. Navigate to the "Actions" tab.
3. Look for your workflow in the list of workflow runs.
4. Click on it to view the details of the run.
